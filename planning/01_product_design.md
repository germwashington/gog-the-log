# **Quick summary**

You want to build a harmless, school-appropriate video game (or small project) that shows off your coding skill, patience, and creativity. The project’s purpose is to impress lots of people — from classmates and family to public figures — and to use the finished product as a clear demonstration that you can plan, build, and finish something technical. You also want a small playful “revenge” element: an Easter-egg or final message (“6-7”) aimed at your sister because she punches you when you say that — but you want it done in a way that’s clever and not mean or unsafe.

# **Outline: main goals, values, and practical plan**

## **1\) Core goals**

* Demonstrate technical skill (coding, debugging, design).

* Show persistence and ability to finish a long project.

* Create something fun and shareable that’s allowed at school.

* Include a playful, harmless Easter-egg (the “6-7” payoff) as a finishing flourish.

## **2\) Target audience**

* Primary: classmates and schoolmates (must be school-safe).

* Secondary: family (sister, parents), friends.

* Tertiary / aspirational: a broader audience (anyone online, even “big” figures if you want to brag).

## **3\) Values to reflect in the project**

* Clean, readable code (so you can show people *how* you built it).

* Politeness & safety (no bullying, harassment, or anything that could get you banned).

* Creativity and personality — little touches that make the project clearly “you.”

* Persistence: show your development process (commits, notes, or a short dev log) to highlight effort.

## **4\) Gameplay / feature ideas (keeps it simple & safe)**

* Short, polished mini-game (platformer, puzzle, or arcade-style).

* One or two standout mechanics that show your coding chops (e.g., physics, AI behavior, procedural levels).

* An Easter-egg sequence that triggers when the player types or reaches “6-7” — a funny animation, confetti, or a lighthearted message like “You found it: 6-7 — payback is a hug” (keeps revenge playful, not harmful).

* High score / replayability so classmates will actually play it.

## **5\) Tech & skills to showcase**

* Language/framework choice (JavaScript \+ HTML5/canvas or Godot / Unity depending on your comfort).

* Clean project structure, comments, and small, well-named functions.

* Version control (git) with commits that show progress — demonstrates patience and workflow.

* Basic assets creation (pixel art, simple sounds) to show design sense.

* A short README or demo video explaining what you built and what you learned.

##  

## **6\) Distribution & presentation plan**

* Build a playable web version (best for school sharing) or an executable that’s safe for school devices.

* Create a 1–2 minute demo video to show people quickly.

* Share links with family & friends; post to a safe repo (GitHub) and optionally a public page (Itch.io for games).

* Prepare a short “pitch” you can give classmates or teachers: 30 seconds to explain what it does and why it’s cool.

## **7\) Ethics & safety (important)**

* Keep the revenge element non-violent and jokey — Easter egg, not harassment.

* Avoid profanity, insults, or anything that could get you in trouble at school.

* Respect privacy and copyright (use your own or free assets).

## **8\) Mini action plan (first steps)**

1. Pick the game type and tech stack (web-based recommended).

2. Outline a 1-page spec: goal, controls, 3 core mechanics, where “6-7” fits.

3. Make a simple prototype (1–2 hours) showing core mechanic.

4. Iterate and polish (add art, sounds, Easter-egg), and commit often to git.

5. Make a short demo video and README, then share.

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page project spec you can print or email, or I can give a step-by-step plan for your chosen tech (for example: JavaScript \+ HTML5). Which tech do you prefer, or should I recommend the easiest path to get a working demo fast?

Critique 

um one thing that i noticed just kind of gets not very interesting because it doesn't progress very far you just after a minute you've leveled up and there's not very much you just do things over and over again without actually doing some things so one thing that i thought would be good there was some way to like have objectives and all of the units changed a little bit including you and like your gun so instead of having four different options or whatever you just have one gun and once you go so far like there's something on the screen that says like next level kind of a loading screen thing and then it like you know the background color is different and it's just a little bit different style like you're in a different place almost like from space just blank space with stars you could change like with planet kind of things in the background and um yeah
